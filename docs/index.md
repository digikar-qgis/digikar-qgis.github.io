# DigiKAR: QGIS hands-on session, 11-12 July 2023
The aim of this session is to provide academics and students in the field of spatial history with a comprehensive introduction to the GIS software QGIS.
Particular attention will be given to the QGIS features that are most valuable for historical studies: **Georeferencing** and **Vectorisation**/Digitisation.

The course will be divided into two main parts, each of which will involve methodology and technical exercises.
The first part will cover the georeferencing capabilities of QGIS for assigning geographic coordinates to existing digitised maps.
The second part will focus on vectorisation, i.e. the creation of geolocalised digital data from previously georeferenced maps.

Particular attention will be paid to the collaborative capabilities of QGIS to collectively build a shared geohistorical database from historical maps.

**This workshop is open to members of the [Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography](https://leibniz-ifl.de) and the [DigiKAR project](https://digikar.eu). <span style="color:#ff9800">‚ö†Ô∏è Remote attendance is not possible</span>**
