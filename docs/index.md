# DigiKAR QGIS hands-on session, 11-12 July 2023
The aim of this session is to provide academics and students in the field of spatial history with a comprehensive introduction to the GIS software QGIS.
Particular attention will be given to the QGIS features that are most valuable for historical studies: **Georeferencing** and **Vectorisation**/Digitisation.

The course will be divided into two main parts, each of which will involve methodology and technical exercises.
The first part will cover the georeferencing capabilities of QGIS for assigning geographic coordinates to existing digitised maps.
The second part will focus on vectorisation, i.e. the creation of geolocalised digital data from previously georeferenced maps.

Particular attention will be paid to the collaborative capabilities of QGIS to collectively build a shared geohistorical database from historical maps.

The workshop is open to members of the [Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography](https://leibniz-ifl.de) and the [DigiKAR project](https://digikar.eu).

!!! info "Registration"
    **Registration is mandatory for all participants, see¬†[#Registration](#registration)**. Full time participation is highly advised as the individual parts of the workshop build on each other.

## üß∞ Technical requirements
- **Bring your own laptop**, with an external mouse. Vectorizing with the pad is awful!
- **Install [QGIS 3.30](https://www.qgis.org/fr/site/forusers/download.html)** before the session.
- Ensure that the **Wi-Fi configuration on your computer is not restricted** by a proxy server or a VPN. QGIS will need to access a remote GIS database on network port 5432, which might be blocked due to your organization's security policies.
