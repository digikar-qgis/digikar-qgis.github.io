## üó∫Ô∏è About the competition
This competition consisted in solving several challenges which arise during the digitization of historical maps.
We were particularly interested in a large map series consisting in many Paris atlases over half a century (1860's-1940's).
For each year, a set of approximately 20 sheets forms a tiled view of the city.
Such maps are highly detailed and very accurate even by modern standards.
The **graphical nature of the content** is visible in the full map sheet illustrated below.

This material provides a very valuable resource for historians and a **rich body of scientific challenges** for the document analysis and recognition (DAR) community: map-related challenges (overlapping of many information layers) and document-related ones (document preservation).

We addressed tasks for three levels of scientific problems:

- [Task 1: Detection of building blocks](tasks/task1.md)
- [Task 2: Segmentation of map content within map sheets](tasks/task2.md)
- [Task 3: Localization of graticule lines intersections](tasks/task3.md)

These tasks are necessary step during the digitization of historical maps, i.e. when gradually turning a raster image into a set of vector geometries projected onto a particular geographical coordinate reference system.
Automatic approaches with good generalization power will provide an enormous gain for the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) communities looking for solutions when digitizing old maps,
and create a great potential for many historical studies.


<!-- ## üöÄ Key strengths for participants
- All datasets and evaluation tools are released with an **open license** as soon as they are available.
- Winners of each task will be invited to **co-author** the report paper.
- We propose unsolved research problems with an **important potential impact**. -->
