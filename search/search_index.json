Particular attention will be given to the QGIS features that are most valuable for historical studies: Georeferencing and Vectorisation /Digitisation. The course will be divided into two main parts, each of which will involve methodology and technical exercises. The first part will cover the georeferencing capabilities of QGIS for assigning geographic coordinates to existing digitised maps. The second part will focus on vectorisation, i.e. the creation of geolocalised digital data from previously georeferenced maps. Particular attention will be paid to the collaborative capabilities of QGIS to collectively build a shared geohistorical database from historical maps. This workshop is open to members of the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography and the DigiKAR project . \u26a0\ufe0f Remote attendance is not possible \ud83d\udcdd Details & registration When : Tuesday 11 (9:30 - 18:00) and Wednesday 12 (9:30 - 15:00) July 2023 Where : Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr L\u00e4nderkunde, Leipzig (IfL), Schongauerstra\u00dfe 9, 04328 Leipzig. Main language : English If you would like to attend, please register by answering this survey \u2139\ufe0f : Click here to register \u2139\ufe0f Renater is the French national research and education network, the personnal data in your answers remains within the UE and are not retained beyond the life of the survey. \ud83e\uddf0 Technical requirements Bring your own laptop , with an external mouse. Vectorizing with the pad is awful! You need to be able to connect to a wifi network with no restrictions (eg. from a VPN). You will need to have access to a remote database on network port 5432. Install QGIS 3.30 before the session.","title":"DigiKAR QGIS hands-on session, 11-12 July 2023"},{"location":"#digikar-qgis-hands-on-session-11-12-july-2023","text":"The aim of this session is to provide academics and students in the field of spatial history with a comprehensive introduction to the GIS software QGIS.
