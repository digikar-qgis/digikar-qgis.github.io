Particular attention will be given to the QGIS features that are most valuable for historical studies: Georeferencing and Vectorisation /Digitisation. The course will be divided into two main parts, each of which will involve methodology and technical exercises. The first part will cover the georeferencing capabilities of QGIS for assigning geographic coordinates to existing digitised maps. The second part will focus on vectorisation, i.e. the creation of geolocalised digital data from previously georeferenced maps. Particular attention will be paid to the collaborative capabilities of QGIS to collectively build a shared geohistorical database from historical maps. The workshop is open to members of the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography and the DigiKAR project . Registration is mandatory for all participants, see #Registration . Full time participation is highly advised as the individual parts of the workshop build on each other. \ud83d\udcdd Details When : Tuesday 11 (9:30 - 18:00) and Wednesday 12 (9:30 - 15:00) July 2023 Where : Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr L\u00e4nderkunde, Leipzig (IfL), Schongauerstra\u00dfe 9, 04328 Leipzig. Who : See section Contacts Main language : English \ud83e\uddf0 Technical requirements Bring your own laptop , with an external mouse. Vectorizing with the pad is awful! Install QGIS 3.30 before the session. Ensure that the Wi-Fi configuration on your computer is not restricted by a proxy server or a VPN. QGIS will need to access a remote GIS database on network port 5432, which might be blocked due to your organization's security policies. \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Registration \u26a0\ufe0f Remote participation is not available \u26a0\ufe0f We are required to limit the number of participants due to space constraints. Therefore we adopt a \"first come, first served\" policy and will close registrations as soon as the maximum number of attendees is reached. However, we may be obliged to turn away the last registrants in the event of large numbers. All participants will receive confirmation of their registration within a few days. Please note that your registration is not validated until you have received a confirmation email. Click here to register Registration is made with Renater's Evento. Renater is the French national research and education network, any personal data (name, email) in your answers will not be retained after the survey closes on July 13 2023.","title":"DigiKAR QGIS hands-on session, 11-12 July 2023"},{"location":"#digikar-qgis-hands-on-session-11-12-july-2023","text":"The aim of this session is to provide academics and students in the field of spatial history with a comprehensive introduction to the GIS software QGIS.
